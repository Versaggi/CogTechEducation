### Desired State: Omaha Sign/Symptom 
###

# This rule is an example of how *ANY* part of the graph put into SMem can be retrieved
# into WM and examined. The key is knowing the graph structure and following the edges
# to the nodes of interest. Below are those for this graph structure.
# 
# EXAMPLE: The Omaha Signs/Symptoms = 'Impotency'
#          The Omaha Problem = 'reproductivefunction'
#          The Prioritization = 'physical', priority = 1.
#          
# SMem Retrieved State Graph:
#
# COMPLETE GRAPH EDGES:
# "^root.omahasignsymptom.omahaproblem.prioritization"
#
# NODES: 'omahasignsymptom'
# "^root.omahasignsymptom.name"
# "^root.omahasignsymptom.code"

# NODE: 'omahaproblem'
